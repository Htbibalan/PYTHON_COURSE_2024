The observed drop in the number of tweets sent by Donald Trump on Fridays in 2020 could be attributed to several factors, both specific and speculative, considering the unique circumstances of that year. Here are some possibilities:

1. **COVID-19 Pandemic:** The global outbreak significantly impacted daily routines, including the President's schedule and priorities. The crisis might have led to changes in communication strategies or an increased focus on crisis management rather than social media engagement on certain days.

2. **Election Year Activities:** 2020 was a U.S. presidential election year. Campaign strategies often shift over time, and there might have been a strategic pivot in how social media was used, including possibly focusing on different platforms or types of engagement, or even different days for specific types of messages.

3. **Increased Scrutiny and Regulation on Social Media:** Throughout 2020, social media platforms, including Twitter, faced increasing scrutiny regarding misinformation, especially related to COVID-19 and the election. This environment might have influenced the frequency and timing of tweets.

4. **Changes in Personal or Professional Schedule:** Donald Trump's personal or presidential schedule might have undergone changes in 2020 that affected his social media activity. This could include more in-person engagements, meetings, or other commitments on Fridays.

5. **Legal and Political Developments:** Specific events, such as the impeachment trial early in the year and subsequent legal and political developments, might have influenced the overall communication strategy, including on social media.

6. **Advisory Changes:** Shifts in the advisory team or communication strategy adjustments could lead to a deliberate change in the frequency of tweets or focus on other days of the week for strategic reasons.

It's important to note that without direct insight into the strategic planning of Trump's communications team or personal habits, these explanations remain speculative. A comprehensive analysis would likely require examining a combination of these factors, along with a detailed review of the content of the tweets, the broader political and social context, and any changes in Twitter's algorithms or policies that might have impacted visibility or engagement.

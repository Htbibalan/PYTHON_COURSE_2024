* Donald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. His tenure in office was marked by significant controversy, unconventional approaches to governance, and a highly polarized political climate.
* The data analyzed in this project was downloaded from [Kaggle ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushggarg/all-trumps-twitter-insults-20152021/data), however it was originally analyzed and released by [The New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/19/upshot/trump-complete-insult-list.html) 
* The data only covers tweets containing an insult or verbal attack, not necessarily all the tweets posted by Donald Trump.

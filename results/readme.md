The image generated by DALL.E shows a surreal photo of Donald Trump in the oval office sending tweets with his mobile phone.
            
* Donald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. His tenure in office was marked by significant controversy, unconventional approaches to governance, and a highly polarized political climate.
* The data analyzed in this project was downloaded from [Kaggle ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushggarg/all-trumps-twitter-insults-20152021/data), however it was originally analyzed and released by [The New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/19/upshot/trump-complete-insult-list.html) 
* The data only covers tweets containing an insult or verbal attack, not necessarily all the tweets posted by Donald Trump.
* Although the data covered tweets posted between 2015-2021, in this project ***I only analyzed tweets posted between first of January 2017 and end of December 2020***, i.e. the period Trump was in charge of the White House.

Fig1) The pie plot wrapped by doughnut plot shows the distribution of tweets posted by Donald Trump between 2017-2020. There is an increase in the percentage of tweets posted by him as he gets towards the end of his period in the office which coincides with the next round of elections and COVID19 pandemic . The doughnut plot also shows how many days out of 1461 days in the office he did not send any tweet containing an insult!

![tweets per week](https://github.com/Htbibalan/PYTHON_COURSE_2024/blob/main/plots/av_tweets_per_week.png)
Fig2) The plot shows average number of insulting tweets  posted per week by Donald Trump. He shows an increasing amount of activity time on social media towards the end of his period in the office.

Fig3 (A) Detailed analysis shows the trend of activity on Twitter on each day of the week per year. Fig3(B) shows the same data as boxplot that might help to better understand the shape of the data. Notably , there is a drop in the number of tweets posted on Fridays in the last year at the office. 
However in general Trump sent most of his tweets on Sundays and fewer tweets on Fridays.The observed drop in the number of tweets sent by Donald Trump on Fridays in 2020 could be attributed to several factors, both specific and speculative, considering the unique circumstances of that year(i.e. the COVID19 pandemic and Election year activities).

Fig4) The plots shows activity pattern of Donald Trump on Twitter over days of a week.

Fig5) The model predicts the chance of sending an insulting tweet across the days of a year

![targets](https://github.com/Htbibalan/PYTHON_COURSE_2024/blob/main/plots/top_10_targets.png)
Fig6) Top 10 targets of tweets posted by Donald Trump. Apparently the "Media"  is by far the biggest target with "Democrates, Russia, and Joe Biden" trailing behind it.




![top_10_insults](https://github.com/Htbibalan/PYTHON_COURSE_2024/blob/main/plots/top_10_insults.png)
Fig7) This plot shows the top 10 insulting terms used by the president of the time in his tweets. Different forms of the term "Fake News Media", "FAKE NEWS" and " Fake News" are not concatenated since they might reflect a different psychological effect, although the terms have the same meaning.

![which media](https://github.com/Htbibalan/PYTHON_COURSE_2024/blob/main/plots/which_media.png)
Fig8) Since "the media" is on the top of the targets, in this plot I break down the top 5 media mentions in the list of targets. Seemingly "the media" in general is against him, but CNN and The New York Times specifically share an almost similar amount of tweets aimed at them.

![which country](https://github.com/Htbibalan/PYTHON_COURSE_2024/blob/main/plots/map_pair.png)
Fig9) Highlighting top 10 countries mentioned in the tweets. Politicians in "the IR" usually blame Trump to justify their failure in developing economy, they believe Trump is just sitting in the office and making troubles for us all the time. This map shows the times each country name was mentioned in his insulting tweets. Although Iran is among the top 10 countries with 77 mentions, but there is a wide gap between Russia and China and the US itself in terms of number of mentions, which shows Trump was "not" mostly busy thinking about "the IR" rather he was either posting about his own country or the eastern block competitors.

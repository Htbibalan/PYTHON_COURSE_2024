# "As a political figure, Donald J. Trump used Twitter to praise, to cajole, to entertain, to lobby,  to establish his version of events — and, perhaps most notably, to amplify his scorn"

#### Unlike what I expected, no coding, text mining or natural language processing was used to extract data from tweets posted by Donald Trump, rather a group of journalist lead by Kevin Quealy <sub>***manually*** </sub> read all the tweets and marked insults and targets! You can read more about this process in an interview published on [The New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/insider/Trump-twitter-insults-list.html).

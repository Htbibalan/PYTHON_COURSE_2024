##### "As a political figure, Donald J. Trump used Twitter to praise, to cajole, to entertain, to lobby,  to establish his version of events — and, perhaps most notably, to amplify his scorn"
                        Kevin Quealy
                        The Complete List of Trump’s Twitter Insults (2015-2021)

# Overview
#### This repository primarily contains data, Python scripts, and plots for a project required by the course **HEL-8048-1 24V Advanced Data Analysis and Visualization Using Programming** at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. Below you will find more information about the organization of this repository, the source of data and further necessary details.

# The source and structure of data

#### The data used in this project was initially downloaded from ![kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushggarg/all-trumps-twitter-insults-20152021). The data reflects all the tweets^ containing insults, posted by Donald Trump, the former US president from 2015 to 2021. Unlike what one might expect, no coding, text mining or natural language processing was used to extract data from tweets posted by Donald Trump, rather a group of journalist lead by Kevin Quealy <sub>***manually*** </sub> read all the tweets and marked insults and targets! You can read more about this process in an interview published on [The New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/insider/Trump-twitter-insults-list.html). 

#### In this project, I filtered the data and limited the tweets to posts between 2017-2020 which corresponds to his years in the office.

^ I use the word "Tweets" and "Twitter" although the name of the brand is changed to X. Simply because I do not like the new name and logo!

# The organization of this repository
* **/data** stores .csv files containing data used in this project
* **/notebooks** is where you will find the script used in this project to filter, group and plot the data
* **/plots** is the folder where the figures generated by the script are stored
* **/results** is the folder where the "final" results and plots of the study are represented with captions, this directory also contains a separate "readme" file that will be automatically displayed as soon as you open the link.
* **/source** contains some files(e.g icons or images) used either in the home-page or other folders of the repository
